# WorkProject
In this assignment I made a REST API application with two endpoints;
First endpoint returns all records from virtual database.
Second endpoint returns a range of records with exception handling.

For imitation of database working I use a NuGet package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory.
Also in project I used the Swagger tools for documenting APIs built on ASP.NET Core 6.
